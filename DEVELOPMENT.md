# Development

This contains some notes on developing this software locally.

# prerequisites

* [goreleaser](http://goreleaser.com)
* [go 1.24](https://go.dev)

# building

List the available make targets.

```
make help
```

## Local Build

Build the binary locally.

```bash
make build
```

## Check the code

Check the code for style and correctness and running tests.

```bash
make check
```

## Copy it to your path

Copy it to your path.

## Docker

### Local Development

Build the Docker image using the local development Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server:dev -f Dockerfile.local .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -e BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN="your-token" buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server:dev
```

# Adding a new Tool

1. Implement a tool following the patterns in the [internal/buildkite](internal/buildkite) package - mostly delegating to [go-buildkite](https://github.com/buildkite/go-buildkite) and returning JSON. We can play with nicer formatting later and see if it helps.
2. Register the tool here in the [internal/stdio](internal/commands/stdio.go) file.
3. Update the README tool list.
4. Profit!

# Validating tools locally

When developing and testing the tools, and verifying their configuration https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector is very helpful.

```
make
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest buildkite-mcp-server stdio
```

Then log into the web UI and hit connect.

# Publishing a release

- Draft a new release on GitHub: https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server/releases/new
- Select a new tag version, bumping the minor or patch versions as appropriate. This project is pre-1.0, so we don't make strong compatibility guarantees.
- Generate release notes
- Save the release as a draft, and mention internal contributors on Slack before publishing
- Publish the release

A Buildkite pipeline will then automatically invoke the publishing pipeline, including publishing to GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, and update binaries to the GitHub release assets.

# Manually releasing to GitHub Container Registry

This process is automated by the CI pipeline, however you can manually release by following these steps:

To push docker images GHCR you will need to login, you will need to generate a legacy GitHub PSK to do a release locally. This will be entered in the command below.

```
docker login ghcr.io --username $(gh api user --jq '.login')
```

Publish a release in GitHub, use the "generate changelog" button to build the changelog, this will create a tag for the release.

Fetch tags and pull down the `main` branch, then run GoReleaser at the root of the repository.

```
git fetch && git pull
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) goreleaser release
```

# Tracing

To enable tracing in the MCP server you need to add some environment variables in the configuration, the example below is showing the claude desktop configuration paired with [honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io), however any OTEL service will work as long as it supports GRPC.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "buildkite": {
            "command": "buildkite-mcp-server",
            "args": [
                "stdio"
            ],
            "env": {
                "BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN": "bkua_xxxxx",
                "OTEL_SERVICE_NAME": "buildkite-mcp-server",
                "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
                "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "https://api.honeycomb.io:443",
                "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS":"x-honeycomb-team=xxxxxx"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
